These are config files to set up a system the way I like it.


Installation

  git clone git://github.com/jney/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
  cd ~/.dotfiles
  rake install
  # edit ~/.gitconfig and personalize it


Environment

I am running on Mac OS X and Ubuntu. I primarily use zsh, but this 
includes some older bash files as well. If you would like to switch 
to zsh, you can do so with the following command.

  chsh -s /bin/zsh

Features

Tab completion is also added to rake and cap commands:

  rake db:mi<tab>
  cap de<tab>

To speed things up, the results are cached in local .rake_tasks~ and 
.cap_tasks~. It is smart enough to expire the cache automatically in 
most cases, but you can simply remove the files to flush the cache.

There are a few key bindings set. Many of these require option to be
set as the meta key. Option-left/right arrow will move cursor by word, 
and control-left/right will move to beginning and end of line. 
Control-option-N will open a new tab with the current directory under
Mac OS X Terminal.
